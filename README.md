# Delivery-time-estimate
The COVID-19 pandemic challenged our life in many aspects,but some industries grew quickly during this period, such as fresh delivery services. As many pieces of research have shown, in this fast-paced society, people value the speed of delivery service. According to Resendes (2020), 31% of customers use delivery service at least twice a week. 33% of customers are willing to pay money in exchange for fast delivery.  For this project, we would like to dive into the food delivery service industry. We’d like to take the standpoint of the third-party food delivery service platforms, such as Uber Eats, Chowbus, DoorDash, etc., which connect the restaurants and consumers. We want to analyze when everything holds constant, how the food delivery time interval will affect consumer’s willingness to place an order.  We wish our results could help us have a better understanding of the influence of wait time on whether a consumer would choose a service or not, which could be helpful in our career. Also, we wish our result to develop a win-win relationship between consumers and service platforms by helping platforms gain more profits and consumers have better user experience.
